# Twitter-Clone

**Twitter-Clone** is a full-stack application under development that simulates the core functionalities of Twitter. The project is built using modern web technologies like React on the front end and Node.js on the back end, offering users a dynamic platform to interact with posts and user content.

## Key Features
- **React Frontend**: A sleek, component-based UI built with React, offering real-time user interactions.
- **Node.js Backend**: Handles API requests and server-side logic, built for scalability and speed.
- **RESTful API**: The app uses a RESTful API to handle data operations such as posting, retrieving, and interacting with tweets.
- **User Authentication**: Plans for secure user login and session handling using JWT tokens (in development).
- **Tweet Posting**: Functionality for creating and managing tweets, similar to the real Twitter experience.

## Project Structure
The repository is divided into two main directories:
- **front-end**: Contains all the React components and frontend logic for rendering the user interface.
- **back-end**: Handles server-side operations, including API routes, database interaction, and authentication (in progress).

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thiessen2003/Twitter-Clone.git

2. **Install Dependencies: Navigate to both the front-end and back-end folders and install their dependencies.**:

3. **Run the Application: Start the frontend and backend servers in separate terminals:**:
   ```bash
